# ‚òÅÔ∏è My First Azure VM Script (via Bash CLI)

This is a Bash script I wrote while following along with a **Microsoft Learn Azure Fundamentals lab** (AZ-900 level). It creates a simple virtual machine (VM) in Microsoft Azure using the Azure CLI.

Azure CLI (in Bash)

Cloud Shell (sandbox mode)

Ubuntu Linux VM

Basic Networking (open-port)

---

## üß† What This Script Does

1. Creates a new **Resource Group**
2. Deploys a basic **Ubuntu Linux VM**
3. Opens **port 80** so it can serve a web page (like a "Welcome to Azure" page)
4. Pulls the **public IP address** of the VM so you can access it in your browser

Once it finishes, you‚Äôll see the IP, and you can run:
```bash
curl http://<you
Real Things I Learned While Doing This

I wanted to make a note here for anyone else trying to follow along (or myself, if I ever forget!):

üîÑ 1. Switch to Bash ‚Äî Not PowerShell

Microsoft Learn lets you use either Bash or PowerShell in Cloud Shell ‚Äî but most tutorials are written in Bash, and I initially got stuck because I was trying to run Bash-style variable assignments like this:

IPADDRESS=$(az vm list-ip-addresses ...)

‚Ä¶inside PS which doesn‚Äôt work.
Double-check your resource group name

Another thing that confused me up was the exact resource group name. In the Microsoft Learn sandbox, it auto-generates names like:
learn-0e97d60f-9a09-404c-852b-30ad4d50580e
So if you accidentally mistype it (even a single letter), the script fails silently or gives weird errors like:
"URL has no host"

I added a random suffix to my resource group name ($RANDOM) in this script just to make it easier for testing.

Notes üìù - 
This script was tested inside the Microsoft Learn sandbox ‚Äî you can do it for free using their guided labs.

Don‚Äôt forget the sandbox times out after about an hour!

üëã About Me

I‚Äôm working toward earning my Microsoft Azure AZ-900 certification and looking to break into tech ‚Äî especially roles related to IT support, cloud, or infrastructure. This is one of my first hands-on cloud projects.

Thanks for checking it out!
